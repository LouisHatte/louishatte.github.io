1. Short Description

Hi, I'm Louis, a 27-year-old experienced developer with a diverse background spanning web and AI.
I am now dedicated to deepening my expertise in Blockchain, the field I am most passionate about.

Solidity is, without a doubt, my favorite programming language.
Its structure is clear-cut, with no hidden complexities.
You can grasp it at the deepest level, from the very first to the last EVM instruction.
I also appreciate that, beyond memory usage and execution time, it introduces the concept of gas efficiency, adding an extra layer of challenge.
