  <h2>From Full Stack to Smart Contract developer</h2>
  <div>
    I'm a full-stack developer transitioning into smart contract development,
    driven by a passion for blockchain technology and decentralized systems.
    With a strong foundation in building scalable web applications, Iâ€™m now
    focusing on crafting secure, efficient, and trustless smart contracts that
    power the next generation of decentralized applications.
